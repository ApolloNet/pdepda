  - chapter: A Region Under the Yoke of the 3rd Reich
    text: <p>In relation to France, Strasbourg and Alsace experienced a situation during the war that was shared only by the Moselle region. In the aftermath of the Armistice, and although no treaty mentioned it, they were integrated de facto into the German Reich from July 1940 onwards. Alsace was henceforth attached to the German state of Baden-Württemberg and placed under the plenipotentiary leadership of <em>Gauleiter</em> Wagner. A brutal policy of "defrancization" and Nazification of the territory then took place. Acts of propaganda, expulsion and repression took place with unprecedented violence and the Jewish communities were among the first victims.</p><p>Bringing together, within their collections, the objects and works that bear witness to one of the darkest periods in the history of Strasbourg and Alsace, the Historical Museum of the City of Strasbourg and the Alsatian Museum wished to evoke the destiny of the Jewish communities of Alsace during the Second World War. This project presented an opportunity to forge a fruitful partnership with the Judeo-Alsatian Museum in Bouxwiller and the ethnology department of the University of Strasbourg, whose contributions enrich the subject.</p><p>Indeed, the exhibition has set itself the objective of returning to those dark times by providing an understanding of phases and mechanisms but also by evoking the diversity of destinies of individuals confronted with these events via various examples. An opportunity thus presented itself to conduct interviews with people who lived through this period but also with others who were custodians of memories. We warmly thank them for their contributions.</p>
  - chapter: The Jews and Alsace, an ancient story
    text: <p>At the start of the 20th century, Alsace was blessed with a large Jewish community whose origins dated back to the 12th century. Having become rural as a result of the persecution and expulsions that took place in cities at the end of the Middle Ages, Alsatian Judaism was different from that of Eastern Europe, in that the members of the community were not grouped together in a <em>shtetl</em> but were mixed within the villages.</p><p>The French Revolution granted full citizenship to Jews while the Concordat under the Empire recognized and organized Jewish worship on the same basis as Catholicism and Protestantism. From 1815 onwards, German Jews immigrated to France en masse. Thus, despite the relocation of many of their members to large French cities, the 19th century saw significant growth in Alsatian Jewish communities and the construction of numerous synagogues throughout the area. From the second half of the 19th century, there was a trend towards rural exodus. More and more members of the Alsatian Jewish community moved to towns and cities in the hope of improving their living conditions. Following the attachment of Alsace and Moselle to the German Empire in 1871, this tendency was reinforced by significant immigration from across the Rhine. The members of the Jewish community were generally city-dwellers employed in academic, industrial or financial activities. The profile of the Alsatian Jewish community changed significantly in the early 20th century. Although still extensive and dynamic, it became more urban, while rural Alsatian Judaism already appeared to be on the decline.</p>

        text: <p>In the 19th century, the vast majority of Jews in France were concentrated in Alsace and Lorraine. Although the attachment of Alsace and Moselle to Germany between 1871 and 1918 led to the emigration of a large number of Alsatian Jews, it was offset by the arrival of Jews from Germany and Central Europe.</p>

        text: <p>The cohabitation of Jewish and non-Jewish communities within Alsatian towns and villages was not always peaceful. As representatives of "the Other", Jews were frequently victims of the violence that arose during economic or political crises, as was the case during the July Revolution of 1848. However, the proximity of populations also promoted understanding and mutual respect which increased with the gradual integration of Jews into society. This is demonstrated in the illustration of the unveiling of a Torah scroll (or Pentateuch) belonging to the Jewish community in Reichshoffen, an event also attended by the non-Jewish community (shown in the foreground).</p>

In the case of the tricolour ornamention of this Mappa, made for Baruch, son of Mordechai, born 10 October 1872 (when Alsace had been under German administration for eighteen months), the parents of the newborn baby demonstrated their attachment to France.</p>"

        text: <p>The emigration of part of the Alsatian Jewish community after 1871 was offset by the arrival of Jews from Germany and central Europe. As they mostly settled in big cities, it was the urban Jewish community of Alsace that underwent significant growth. In Strasbourg, it grew from 2,820 members in 1861 to 8,000 in 1889. The construction of the Great Synagogue, from 1896 to 1898, by the architect Ludwig Lévy testifies to this vitality. After 1918, some of these people tried to stay in Alsace. Not all succeeded and were deported to Germany by the French. They were subsequently among the first victims of the Nazi regime.</p>

  - chapter: September 1939 – July 1940. The evacuation of Strasbourg and the banks of the Rhine 
    text: <p>In anticipation of the conflict that seemed inevitable, an evacuation plan was put in place as early as 1936 for municipalities located in the immediate vicinity of the Maginot Line. All the municipalities located within 5 to 8 km of the Rhine had to be cleared of inhabitants as soon as war was declared. The municipalities located near the Rhine organised the protection of their populations with the utmost discretion. This device was activated in September 1939. Around 300,000 Alsatians gathered at assembly points from where they were evacuated by train to various towns in southwestern France. Only a small number of officials and soldiers remained in place to ensure the protection of property and buildings. Following the armistice signed in Rethondes on 22 June 1940, the refugees were invited to return home. Known Francophiles, state officials and Jews (who were also excluded from the French civil service by the Vichy regime) were not allowed to return!</p>

  - chapter: In the vise of nazi Alsace
    text: <p>All anti-Jewish Nazi legislation was applied in Alsace and Moselle, both of which were annexed to the German Reich. This manifested itself in the desire to make these regions Judenrein (without Jews) like the rest of the Reich.</p><p>The circular of 13 July 1940 organised this "purification". This was implemented very quickly and brutally for the deportees who sometimes only had a few hours to leave their homes. Each individual was entitled to 30 kg of luggage (valuables and artworks were excluded) and 150 Reichsmarks. Their homes were then put under seal and their goods sold at auction for the benefit of the Reich. The Nazi regime continued its policy of annihilating all traces of Jewish presence and heritage in the region. The Strasbourg synagogue fire is one example, and several documents illustrate this policy, including pre-employment forms which featured several sections intended to verify the absence of Jewish ancestry.</p>

On 14 July 1940, he and his family were expelled from Alsace and took refuge in the Jura. He was able to attend the municipal school and subsequently the high school in Lons-le-Saunier. However, from 1942 onwards the hunt for Jews intensified and the principal suggested that his parents allow Gilbert to board at the school in order to avoid travelling back and forth. During the holidays, the young teenager was hidden in the establishment and prohibited from communicating with anyone. In order to counter his boredom and anxiety the boy drew images in his notebooks of his expulsion from Alsace in the summer of 1940. Captions were added by Gilbert Weil after the war.</p>"

In essence: the Jews are a people foreign to Europe, whose integration poses the same problems as that of Mamelukes, Gypsies, Chinese, Indians, etc. As their attributions have been known for over 3000 years, how many of them are likely to be integrated without causing harm (to Germany) and should not the solution involve their return to Palestine?</p><p>Herder's text “Die Juden/The Jews”, taken from <em>Adrastea</em> (1801), is part of a set of reflections on possible intellectual rapprochements between different peoples of different faiths.

One of the arguments intended to justify these experiments was that they would save the lives of German soldiers.

        text: <p>In 1941, the chair of anatomy at the Nazi University of Strasbourg was given to August Hirt (Mannheim, 1898 - Schluchsee, 1945). In this context, Hirt carried out several operations on human guinea pigs. From 1941 onwards he also supervised the work of the anthropologist Beger, who used "human material". For this study, 86 Jews were transported from Auschwitz to Natzwiller where they were exterminated in a gas chamber at the end of July 1943. Their corpses were then transported to the Strasbourg Institute of Anatomy where they were stored in a special liquid. Some of these corpses appear to have also been used in testicular studies by Hirt's assistant Anton Kiesselbach (Kempenich, 1907 - Dusseldorf, 1984). These corpses were partially disposed of on the arrival of Allied troops, in November 1944, and then buried in the Jewish cemetery of Strasbourg-Cronenbourg. An assistant had copied the list of the numbers on the bodies, which allowed the identification in particular of Menachem Taffel (1900-1943), a Berlin merchant and husband of Klara Schenkel. His 14-year-old daughter, Esther, was an aide at the Jewish community hospital. On 12 March 1943 the Taffel family, along with 7,749 other Jews, was deported from Berlin to Auschwitz where Klara and Esther were immediately sent to the gas chamber. Menachem was selected three months later for the “collection of skeletons”. His name was later given to a quay alongside the civil hospital that previously housed the Anatomy Institute of the Reichsuniversität run by Hirt.<br/>After the war, having lost his wife and son in the Allied bombardments of Strasbourg, Hirt returned to Germany and committed suicide in the Black Forest.</p>

        text: <p>These objects belong to Fanny Glicksmann, née Tenenbaum, and her brother Jacques (now deceased) and bear witness to their life in Périgord between 1939 and 1944. Born respectively in 1931 and 1933 in Strasbourg, shortly after the arrival of their parents from Poland, Jacques and Fanny were evacuated to Saint-Pierre-de-Chignac with their mother in 1939. Fanny was only six years old at the time. While she does not remember this event more precisely, the milk jug and coloured sticks, which she used to learn to count, remind her of her daily life in that small village in Périgord. The same goes for the school exercise books belonging to her brother, then a student at the high school in Périgueux. His name appears on the covers, a sign that the family, like many Jewish families, was not living in hiding even as the roundups began to come into force. During the roundup of 16 March 1944, Ethel, the mother of Fanny and Jacques, was arrested. She pushed her children away when they ran to her. Jacques fled in despair. Fanny was taken in by neighbours, then entrusted to another family. Ethel was released after two weeks, following a decision by a senior official to release the women. The whole family survived the war. Fanny, however, did not forget this event and obtained the honorary title of Righteous Among the Nations for the couple who saved her in 1944.</p>

        text: "<p>Simone Polak was ten years old at the start of the war and lived in Saverne with her mother and younger brother. Expelled from Alsace on 15 July 1940, she took refuge in the Jura at Gevingey. A meeting of resistance fighters was scheduled for 26 April 1944, two kilometers from the village but was canceled at the last moment. The next day, in reprisal, German officers obtained the list of Jewish residents of the village from the mayor (under duress). Simone, her brother and her mother were arrested along with 20 other people of the Jewish faith. Interned at Drancy, they were deported to Auschwitz on 20 May. A survivor of the camps, Simone now lives in Strasbourg and has carried out important acts of testimony and transmission to the younger generation. She has published a book retracing her journey, Act as if I were always by your side (Le Manuscrit editions, 2018). This is the last recommendation made to Simone Polak by her mother on the train before arriving at Auschwitz and which can be interpreted as heralding the sad events that followed. The following excerpts are taken from an interview conducted at her home in April 2021 for the exhibition.</p>"

  - chapter: Resilience and transmission of memory
    text: "<p>The return to Alsace of the survivors of the Jewish community was painful. In addition to the suffering caused by exile and the disappearance of many of their loved ones, there was the loss of collective landmarks: many synagogues and cemeteries had been destroyed, burned or desecrated. Despoiled of all their property in 1940, the Jews of Alsace had to assert their rights to recover, not without difficulty, their housing and their furniture. Most of them settled in cities, accelerating the decline of traditional rural Judaism.</p><p>Despite these trials and tribulations, the post-war period was also a period of renewal for Alsatian Judaism. Several institutions were rebuilt and new ones emerged such as the Aquiba school (1948). Although, after consultation, it was decided not to rebuild the Great Synagogue in Strasbourg, a new building in a different location was inaugurated in 1958 despite the sometimes very harsh opposition of certain Strasbourg residents.</p><p>Today, the face of Alsatian Judaism has changed significantly. More urban, it also diversified following the arrival of communities from North Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. Questions therefore arise concerning the transmission of the memory of the fate of the Second World War Jewish community and attachment to the heritage of traditional Alsatian Judaism. While the descendants of the pre-war communities may be its natural custodians, are they the only ones? Might Alsatian Judaism not also be a shared heritage which each Alsatian can relate to, despite the vicissitudes of history?</p>"

        text: <p>In the aftermath of the war, the Jewish community in Strasbourg struggled to rapidly resume a normal life. With the Great Synagogue destroyed, the community gathered in that of Kageneck Street, whose location in the urban fabric had preserved it from destruction. After the installation of a temporary synagogue (in use from 1950 to 1958 in the ancient city arsenal) it was decided to construct a new building on a site separate from that occupied by the Great Synagogue. The Contades park, situated to the north of the city centre, was selected. The new building, built according to the plans of the Parisian architect Claude Meyer-Levy, assisted by the Strasbourg architect Jean-Paul Berst, was conceived as a resolutely modern building in its form, combining both religious and cultural functions. The Peace Synagogue was inaugurated on 23 March 1958. During the celebration, the procession transferring the Tablets of the Law from the provisional synagogue to the new building made a detour in order to stop and gather together at the site of the Great Synagogue, thereby establishing a link between the three buildings.</p>

This was the beginning of an investigative work that she carried out for several years with her students, retracing the fate of this man engulfed by the Shoah. This research resulted in a play, a documentary and a piece entitled Kaddish for a prof.

Today it has a different profile from that of the pre-war era, being more urban than rural and more diverse. The richness of the Jewish heritage of Alsace has aroused an increase in public interest in recent years, as demonstrated by the influx of visitors each year during the days of Jewish culture, initiated in 1995 in the Lower Rhine area and today available on a European scale. In turn, many objects testify to the attachment of the Jewish community of Alsace to this territory. Such is the case with this mappah, embroidered by Lazare Lévy for Didier Karlebach (born in 1954 in Strasbourg) in which elements of the flora and fauna of Alsace are juxtaposed with references to the land of Israel.</p>"
