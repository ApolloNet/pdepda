    text: "<p>Nazi repression in the Reich-occupied territories was of a rare violence that served a destructive ideology and responded to the stakes of the global conflict. German repression in occupied France took many forms, such as shootings, deportations, and massacres. The goals (maintaining order, securing labour needs, exterminating “undesirables”), the enforcers (police and military), the victims (opponents, Resistance fighters, civilians, Jews and gypsies), the locations, and the methods of this repression varied in the context of a globalized war. When used as an overarching policy or governance tool, repression is a signature of authoritarian regimes. While Germany pursued a policy of racial ideology and a quest for unlimited <em>Lebensraum</em> or “living space,” the Vichy regime and French law enforcement also actively served the Nazi project.</p><p>This exhibition presents the unique history of Marseille during the Second World War. As a last haven open to the world, Marseille welcomed thousands of refugees fleeing Europe in 1940 in the hope of finding a better life. In the summer of 1942, this safe haven would become a place of peril. In January 1943, with the help of State collaboration, Marseille experienced one of the major roundups of the occupation that resulted in the deportation of hundreds of Marseille families, most of whom were Jewish, as well as the destruction of the Old Town. Our duties to history and memory are intertwined: each informs the other to help us better remember the past and understand our issues of today.</p>"
  - chapter: "Marseille: City of Sanctuary, Escape Routes, and Aid to Refugees"
    text: <p>In the summer of 1940, Marseille, the only large port in the free zone still open to the world, became a main sanctuary city in unoccupied France. French citizens and foreigners were under threat from Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. Refugees ended up there in the hope of finding a way out. Many were Jewish, but they also included a number of political activists, intellectuals, artists, and a congregation of Europe’s avant-garde.</p><p>The city’s escape routes, aid, and relief to refugees, along with its Jewish organizations and Christian groups, made Marseille the setting for what is now considered the earliest Resistance activities.</p>

Another of his tasks was to declare British soldiers interned at Fort Saint-Jean as medically unfit so that they could be repatriated to England.</p>

        text: <p>Gilberto Bosques, Mexican Consul in France, played an important role in saving refugees thanks to an agreement reached on August 23, 1940 between the Mexican government, which consented to receive Spanish Republican exiles, and the French State, which assured them asylum. As a result, hundreds of people were able to leave Marseille by boat. From 1940 to 1942, hundreds of Spaniards waiting to leave for Mexico stayed in two large bastides (or country manor houses) in the Huveaune River Valley in Saint-Menet. The men were housed at the Château de la Reynarde, and the women and children stayed at the Château Montgrand. Here, a group of six men with luggage look at a sign that reads, “Residence of the United Mexican States.”</p>

  - chapter: "From Refuge to Trap: The Spectre of Internment and the Roundup of Jews in Provence"
    text: <p>The policy of State collaboration also had tragic consequences in the region even before the occupation of the free zone in November 1942.</p><p>From September 1939 to June 1940, the Camp des Milles near Aix-en-Provence was an internment camp for “enemy aliens.” The Third Republic decided to intern all Reich nationals who had nevertheless fled from Nazism. From July 1940 to July 1942, the Vichy government turned Camp des Milles into a transit camp for “undesirables” awaiting immigration. The men were interned at Camp des Milles, and the women and children were put in hotels in Marseille. Others were assigned to the “foreign workers’ groups.” After the Vél d’Hiv roundup in the summer of 1942, the Nazis, as part of their “Final Solution,” pressured the Vichy government to increase deportations of “foreign” Jewish families. The free zone was not spared. Pierre Laval, Vice-President of the Council of Ministers, pledged to deliver 10,000 Jewish men, women and children. The Camp des Milles therefore became a gateway for the deportation of nearly 2,000 people, including over 100 children, to Auschwitz.</p>

        text: <p>Between the summer of 1940 and November 1942, an estimated 910 women and children passed through Marseille’s Hôtel Bompard, an internment centre for women and children awaiting immigration. Overall, 44.3% of the interned women had an experience at a French camp, as most had been interned at Gurs, the largest French internment camp in the Basses-Pyrénées in the free zone. As was the case at supervised centres, initiatives such as school lessons and recreational activities were provided to distract the interned, and particularly the children, from their traumatic surroundings.</p>

        text: <p>In July 1940, the French regions of Alsace and Moselle were amalgamated with the German states of Baden and Gau in Saar-Palatinate, respectively. Both regions were ruled by a Gauleiter (a district leader from the Third Reich) with full authority to rid their area of any non-French, drive out any undesirables who could not be “Germanified,” and expel Jews to make these areas Judenfrei, or “free of Jews.” On October 22 and 23, 1940, 6,504 Jews from Baden and Saarland were arrested and deported to the French camp in Gurs and then to the Camp des Milles. Of this number, about 5,600 Jews come from 137 communities in Baden. The Wertheimer family were among the deported.</p>

    text: "<p>Less than two months after their arrival in Marseille on November 12, 1942, the Germans, under the pretext of responding to organized Resistance attacks, wanted to set an example. They placed the city under siege on January 5, 1943. Ordered by Hitler himself, “Operation Sultan” was carried out from January 22 to February 17, 1943 in collaboration with the French authorities and police.</p><p>This operation marked the first mass roundup of French Jewish families in Marseille along with the evacuation and destruction of the north quarter of the Old Port, which to the Nazis symbolized the “gangrene” of Marseille, with its crime, vice, filth and cosmopolitanism.</p><p>The sheer human, logistical and material numbers from this operation were unparalleled and dire: 12,000 gendarmes, GMR (mobile reserve groups) and mobile guards from all over France; 40,000 identity checks; 5,956 people arrested; 1,642 people, including 782 Jews from the roundups, deported to the Sobibor killing centre; 20,000 people evacuated from the north quarter of the Old Port; 15,000 people crammed into cattle cars to be transferred to a military camp in Fréjus, 140 km from Marseille; 800 people in Fréjus selected for deportation to concentration camps; and 1,494 buildings destroyed covering 14 hectares of land.</p>"

The French authorities concentrated considerable forces from Paris, Lyon, Vichy and Toulouse: 200 inspectors not only from the south zone but also from Paris, and about 8,000 uniformed men (gendarmes, mobile guards and mobile reserve troops) and 2,000 security troops. The Vichy police carried out mass arrests at people’s homes, in the street, in cafés, in movie theatres and on trains.  Locksmiths were hired to break into houses. The “Opera” raids took place from 11:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. the night of January 22 to 23. The Hasson family was arrested the night of January 23.</p>"

        text: <p>On the morning of Sunday, January 24, residents of the north quarter of the Old Port woke to learn they had been cut off from the rest of the city the night before. The forced evacuation involved 12,000 French police officers and 5,000 soldiers from the 10th SS Police Regiment commanded by Colonel Griese. People were awakened at 6:00 a.m. by loudspeakers ordering them to leave everything behind. About 25,000 people were evacuated. While 5,000 were allowed to cross the barricade, others were taken to Marseille’s Arenc station in trolleys commandeered at Quai Maréchal Pétain, or the port’s quay at the time, and then crammed into cattle cars to be taken to an old colonial troop camp in Fréjus.</p>

        text: <p>On February 1, a convoy of 800 people, including 200 Jews screened at Fréjus, left for Compiègne-Royallieu, a transit camp and deportation centre in the north of France. To justify Operation Sultan, 600 non-Jewish “suspects,” who were essentially young people from Italian, Corsican, Greek and Spanish families, were selected at random to lend credibility to the idea that the official policy was to “cleanse” and “find undesirables.” On April 28, they are deported to Mauthausen, Buchenwald, and especially Sachsenhausen. A contingent was given to the Organisation Todt and interned on the Channel Islands, which Germany had started occupying in June 1940, to work on major construction projects, such as the Atlantic Wall.</p>

The buildings that escaped the mass destruction were the City Hall, Église Saint-Laurent, customs building and sanitation station, Hôtel de Cabre, and Maison Diamantée, all heritage sites that symbolize the destroyed historic perimeter.</p>

    text: <p>“<em>Memory is one of our duties, but passing on memory requires the truth.</em>” François Bédarida (1926-2001), French Resistance fighter and historian.</p><p>At the foot of Fort Saint-Jean, facing the Old Town that was completely destroyed in 1943 during Operation Sultan (see previous chapter), the Mémorial des Déportations is housed in an infirmary bunker built in 1943, a vestige of the German military presence in the occupied city. Created as a dynamic space that constantly evolves, the Mémorial reveals the policies of repression and persecution in Marseille during the Second World War. As the last witnesses to this time leave us, the memorial passes on the history and memory of the men, women and children who were arrested and deported because they were born Jewish or who were repressed because they were political figures, Resistance fighters, hostages or “suspects”.</p>

This bunker is part of the entire defensive fortification of the port of Marseille and more broadly of the Südwall of the Organisation Todt. The Südwall, also called the Mediterranean Wall, was an extensive coastal fortification system built by the Third Reich to prevent an Allied invasion. This building was taken in the fight for the liberation of Marseille in August 1944. General de Monsabert, representing the Allied French forces, and General Schaefer, representing the German troops in Marseille, held an initial meeting in front of its walls on August 23, 1944 to negotiate the Germans’ official surrender in Marseille.</p>

Eugène Claudius-Petit, head of the MRU from 1948 to 1953, significantly reworked the projects and appointed new chief architects to find innovative and cost-effective solutions. Combining concrete with stone was one popular method: for example, architects Pouillon and Devin preferred stone, Castel and Rozan-Chirié used stone with concrete, Dunoyer de Segonzac chose raw concrete, while Crozet opted for panels of pink washed-gravel slabs. The main attraction of this cohesive construction was, of course, the superb alignment of nearly 600 metres of massive solid stone blocks in front of the area of City Hall, which now represents one of Marseille’s most iconic sights.</p>"
