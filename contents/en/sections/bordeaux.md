  - chapter: Introduction
    text: "<p>The Centre National Jean Moulin was founded in 1967 at the instigation of Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Compagnon de la Libération and Mayor of Bordeaux between 1947 and 1995. It has been part of the Museum of Aquitaine since 2006. Its primary purpose is as a place of remembrance for those who resisted the Nazis, and for those who lost their lives under the occupation. But it also has a second role: to promote research into the French Resistance, the Free French Forces and the Deportation, while helping to shape an understanding of the modern world.</p><p><em>Ports of Exile, Home Harbours</em> is a virtual exhibition launched in spring 2020 to trace the individual and collective fates of Jewish populations on both sides of the Atlantic during the Second World War. The history of Bordeaux is inseparable from that of its large, long-standing and active Jewish community. The occupation and the French collaboration had a profound impact on this community. Its members, although fully integrated into civil society, were forced to flee into exile or go into hiding in order to avoid extermination.</p><p>This exhibition draws primarily on objects and documents from the Centre National Jean Moulin collection, which serve as a testament to the human tragedy that afflicted the Jewish population of Bordeaux during the Second World War.</p>"
  - chapter: The emergence of anti-Semitism in France and Bordeaux
    text: <p>The first documented records of people of Jewish faith in Bordeaux date to the 1st century AD. However, the earliest evidence of a permanent population comes from archaeological sources dating to the 6th century AD. It was around this same time that Gregory of Tours described a scene of a Jew debating with a priest in Bordeaux about the cult of saints, which had already become part of an anti-Jewish narrative. In 848, Prudentius of Troyes accused the Jews of complicity in the Vikings’ sacking and burning of Bordeaux. The Middle Ages saw a gradual increase in harassment of Jewish communities and anti-Semitic measures. In 1214, the Council of Bordeaux condemned the Jews for being usurers. In 1222, the Archbishop of Bordeaux enacted a papal decision forcing Jews to wear an identifying badge. Successive kings of England introduced specific tax regimes for Jews before ultimately ordering their expulsion and the seizure of their property in 1287.</p>

        text: "<p>Representations of the Church and the Synagogue in female form are a common allegory in Christian art from the Middle Ages. The Church symbolises Christianity, while the Synagogue represents Judaism. This representation of the Synagogue on the southern portal of the Basilica of St Severinus in Bordeaux is a particularly negative depiction of Judaism. The woman’s eyes are covered by a snake, suggesting that the Jewish people are blind to the divinity of Christ, while the purse in her hand refers to the stereotype of greed.</p>"

  - chapter: The intensification of anti-Semitism in France and Bordeaux
    text: <p>A new Jewish community developed in Aquitaine, consisting of people from the Iberian Peninsula who fled persecution in Spain (1492 onwards) and Portugal (1536 onwards). The refugees were forced to confirm to Catholic doctrine, while a ban meant that Judaism could only be practised in hiding. The New Christians from Spain and Portugal did not gain recognition as Jews until 1723. But they were still required to register with the authorities in order to live in accordance with their customs. Many of them became traders, ship-owners and bankers. They were granted full citizenship rights under the French Revolution. Judaism was recognised as an official religion and Jews were able to practise openly between First French Empire and the Third French Republic. But this official recognition coincided with a growing wave of increasingly virulent anti-Semitism, as evidenced by the Dreyfus affair, which divided French society from 1894 onwards.</p>

        text: <p>The Great Synagogue of Bordeaux was rebuilt after the earlier building was destroyed by fire in 1873. Construction work on the new synagogue began in 1877 and was completed in 1882. The work was funded by the Pereire brothers, the Rothschild family and Daniel Iffla (known as Osiris). The new building was designed by architects Charles Durand and Paul Abadie, who took over the project following the death of André Burguet. The synagogue reflects both the Gothic and Oriental styles of the era. The vast facade features two towers, one at either side, appended to the central edifice, echoing the artistic sensibilities of the time. The monumental quality of the sanctuary is further underscored by the Tablets of Stone at the top of the pediment. The metal roof was made at Gustave Eiffel’s workshops. Inside, the synagogue features a main area with pews and a central stage for services of worship, plus side areas separated by Corinthian columns. The Torah ark appears in a large gallery at the rear of the building.</p>

It was published in 1898 in the free supplement of newspaper <em>Le Siècle</em>, which called for a retrial of Dreyfus’ case. The poster features various well-known politicians and intellectuals in support of the cause. Many shops were damaged in Bordeaux and riots broke out in the city. On 17 January 1898, for instance, hundreds of students took to the streets shouting <em>“Down with the Jews! Down with Dreyfus! Down with Zola!”</em>. On 8 October of the same year, the synagogue’s railings were  smashed. Dreyfus was rehabilitated in 1906.</p>

        text: "<p>This political poster relates to Adolphe Willette’s candidacy for the legislative elections on 22 September 1889. It combines anti-Semitic and nationalist symbolism: a Jew fleeing from a Gaul, a worker holding a sledgehammer, a middle-class man armed with a rifle, a gendarme saluting behind him, and the image of Marianne, here depicted wearing trousers, standing atop fortifications blowing a horn and holding the Gallic rooster, the national symbol of France. On the ground lie a shattered Talmud and the ubiquitous leather purse, which has shed several coins.</p><p>Adolphe Willette came nowhere close to winning the election in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. But it was a different story in Bordeaux, where Albert Chiché was elected to parliament for the second Bordeaux constituency in 1889 after running on an openly anti-Semitic ticket. Prior to that, Charles Bernard, who was elected to parliament for Gironde in 1893, joined the Anti-Jewish group in the Chamber of Deputies. This poster was re-printed in 1943 as part of the anti-Jewish propaganda campaign by the occupying forces and the Vichy government.</p>"

  - chapter: The Nazis’ anti-Semitic ideology
    text: <p>The political system that Mussolini established in Italy in 1922 following the March on Rome combined populism, nationalism and totalitarianism. The ideological doctrine pursued by the fascist regime was opposed to the humanist and progressive philosophical values of the Age of Enlightenment. Human rights were rejected and individuals became insignificant. Nazism, which became the dominant ideology in Germany following Hitler’s accession to power on 30 January 1933, was a more radical, racially motivated version of fascism. Drawing on elements of pseudo-science, the Nazis believed in the superiority of the Aryan race over the Jews, Slavs and Roma. Anti-Semitism and racism were embedded in state doctrine, which was enacted by a unique and increasingly powerful, complex and murderous administration.</p>

It contains a series of 12 illustrations along with a legend and a quotation from Adolf Hitler. The booklet illustrates a shift away from the anti-Semitism of the previous centuries and towards a form of overtly racist anti-Semitism driven by the assertion that Jews are unable to change their condition.  The Nuremberg Laws were enacted in 1935, creating a distinction between citizens of the Reich and Jews based on the idea of the purity of German blood. Numerous materials were published to accompany the enactment of the laws.</p>

  - chapter: Aristides de Sousa Mendes’ decision to act
    text: <p>Amid the rise of Nazism, many German Jews fled the Reich, seeking refuge in Bordeaux and elsewhere in south-western France. Joseph Cohen, the chief rabbi of Bordeaux, was a member of the National Refugee Assistance Committee in Paris and oversaw local support and assistance activities. The outbreak of hostilities on 10 May 1940 prompted a mass exodus and, with the army in retreat, the French Republic was on the brink of collapse.</p><p>As thousands of people fled the advancing German troops in distress, Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes began issuing visas on request. He acted of his own volition and against the instructions of his government, driven by a desire to help affected communities – including many Jews who had sought refuge in Bordeaux – escape the threat of Nazi persecution. With the assistance of his wife, his son, his nephew and rabbi Kruger (whom he sheltered in his home with his family), Sousa Mendes saved close to 30,000 people – a third of whom were Jews – between 15 and 26 June 1940.</p>

        text: <p>Aristides de Sousa Mendes do Amaral e Abranches was born on 19 July 1885 in Cabanas de Viriato, Portugal. Destined for a career as a diplomat, he studied law and went on to hold various roles in Africa, the United States, Brazil, Spain and Belgium. On 29 September 1938, he was appointed as Portuguese consul in Bordeaux. He lived with his 14 children in a large apartment at 14 Quai Louis XVIII, where his offices were also located. Sousa Mendes was denounced for having issued thousands of unauthorised visas and was disciplined following his return to Portugal on 8 July 1940. His actions went unrecognised until after his death in 1954.</p><p>Rabbi Chaim Hersz Kruger fled Poland in 1939, seeking refuge in the Netherlands with his wife and five children. As the German forces advanced, he and his family fled once again, this time heading to Bordeaux in search of a visa so they could travel on to Spain and Portugal. There, Kruger met Sousa Mendes, who took the rabbi and his family into his home. With their help, Sousa Mendes issued the thousands of visas that saved countless lives from Nazi persecution.</p>

  - chapter: SS Massilia
    text: <p>With the French army defeated, a disagreement broke out between advocates of an armistice and those calling for continued resistance using the territorial and military resources of France’s colonies. Marshal Philippe Pétain, who enjoyed unrivalled prestige, was among those advocating for an armistice. The opposing camp included Charles de Gaulle and Georges Mandel. Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned at a meeting of the French Cabinet in Bordeaux on 16 June 1940. Pétain was tasked with forming a new government. Georges Mandel was sacked. He was arrested the following day and imprisoned at Fort du Hâ, but was released shortly afterwards following an intervention by French President Albert Lebrun. The armistice negations began on 17 June, but backup plans were also drawn up in case the talks failed, with a number of parliamentarians being sent to Morocco to continue the fighting. Mandel and Pierre Mendès France were among the 30 parliamentarians who embarked on the <em>SS Massilia</em> on 21 June. The armistice agreement was signed on 22 June. The <em>Massilia</em> arrived in Casablanca on 24 June and Mandel was arrested. He, along with Pierre Mendès France, was held up as an example of a Jewish deserter, as evidenced by the speech given by the Minister of Information in Bordeaux in summer 1940.</p>

        text: <p>The <em>SS Massilia</em> was an ocean liner belonging to the Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique. She was launched in 1914 and completed in 1920. The <em>Massilia</em> served routes between the ports of Bordeaux, Lisbon, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. One of the ship’s notable voyages carried 30 parliamentarians to Morocco in June 1940, under official instruction from the French government to prepare to continue the fighting against the Nazis in France’s colonies. The parliamentarians were subsequently arrested, with most accused of desertion in an effort to discredit them. The <em>Massilia</em> later served as a troop ship for the Vichy government. In 1944, it was scuttled by the Germans in Marseille in order to block the entrance to the port.</p>

  - chapter: The arrival of the occupying forces and the creation of persecution structures in Bordeaux
    text: <p>The arrival of the German troops in Bordeaux on 30 June 1940 disrupted daily life and placed the many Jews remaining in the city in great danger. Some 1,200 German Jewish prisoners were transferred from the Gurs and Saint-Cyprien internment camps to the Boudet barracks on Rue de Pessac. In order to meet its military imperatives and fulfil its new civil, economic and persecution roles, the Wehrmacht commandeered around 40 buildings in the city, including many properties owned by Jews. Measures were introduced to make life deliberately difficult, including moving to the German time zone and restricting freedom of movement. Once the initial shock of the defeat had passed, the hostile intentions of the occupying forces soon became clear. People wrote inscriptions on walls, tore posters, booed in cinemas and engaged in late-night confrontations as initial acts of resistance. But the punishments meted out reflected the brutal reality of German military justice. On 26 August 1940, Israel Leizer Karp was executed by firing squad for shouting insults and threatening a passing German column.</p>

Karp was convicted of assaulting the drum major of the German guard as the troops were marching to raise the flag at Bordeaux-Saint-Jean station. He was executed at Souge camp on 27 August 1940. Little is known about his life. His papers indicate that he was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1886. He reportedly served in the First World War and was said to have lived in Martignas-sur-Jalles, where a street is named after him. According to the <em>Stadkommandant</em>, he had attacked the drum major with a stick. But this account was refuted by several eye-witnesses, who reported only seeing a man shaking his fist. These notices of execution, printed on red paper, were plastered across the city in order to instil fear.</p>

  - chapter: The anti-Semitic ideology of the Vichy government’s National Revolution
    text: <p>The Vichy government charged the Republic and the parliamentary system with responsibility for the fall of France. Under the National Revolution, the regime’s official ideology, so-called “undesirables” (who were blamed for the defeat) were ostracised and persecuted with zeal, to the great satisfaction of the German authorities. The regime introduced an initial set of anti-Jewish measures soon after coming to power. The law of 22 July 1940 created a committee to review naturalisations, and many Jewish émigrés were stripped of their French citizenship. A German order issued on 27 September 1940 required the identification of all Jews and Jewish-owned businesses in the occupied zone. Two-tone notices in German and French, reading <em>“Judisches geschaeft – Entreprise juive”</em> (Jewish-owned business) appeared on shop windows across Bordeaux. Many of these shops had their windows smashed. Some 5,172 Jews were identified, including 1,844 in Bordeaux and its suburbs alone. At the time, Adrien Marquet, the Mayor of Bordeaux, also served as Minister of the Interior in the Vichy government.</p>

The Jew is depicted as a stereotypical physical caricature and is clutching a purse containing British pounds in his hands. Yet the Jewish community made an undeniable contribution during the First World War, when the entire population of France was put on a war footing, irrespective of class or religion. Before his arrival in Bordeaux, rabbi Joseph Cohen had served as a chaplain to the 16th and 18th army divisions in Verdun. Many Jews were commended for heroism in the Order of the Army. This poster was published by the <em>Ligue française</em> (French League) collaborationist movement in 1942.</p>

  - chapter: The anti-Jewish legislative measures
    text: <p>The Vichy government adopted its first set of anti-Jewish legislative measures on 3 October 1940. Members of the Jewish community were barred from roles in government, teaching and the armed forces, as well as from working as licensed professionals and in the entertainment and media industries. An exception to this rule remained for decorated servicemen from the First World War and from 1939-1940. The law was prepared by Raphaël Alibert, who had ordered the arbitrary arrest of Georges Mandel in Bordeaux on 17 June 1940. The regime adopted its second set of anti-Jewish legislative measures on 28 June 1941. These new measures compounded the hardship faced by Jews, who were forced to have the word “Jew” stamped in red on their ID and ration cards. A series of German orders sought to isolate the Jews by banning them from owning a telephone and, subsequently, a radio receiver. As of 8 July 1941, they were also prohibited from visiting public places such as restaurants, cafés, parks, cinemas, theatres and sporting events. On 29 May 1942, wearing the yellow star became mandatory for all members of the Jewish community above six years of age.</p>

He went on to serve as deputy to mayor Adrien Marquet, with responsibility for registry and litigation matters. Benzacar was stripped of his public office following the enactment of the anti-Jewish legislative measures. His home was commandeered and his assets were seized in 1942. He was arrested, along with his wife, on 6 February 1944. The couple were detained at Mérignac internment camp before being transferred to Drancy camp on 13 May 1944. They were deported to Auschwitz on 20 May 1944 and sent to the gas chambers shortly after their arrival, on 25 May 1944.</p>

    text: <p>The Vichy government set up the Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs on 29 March 1941. The body was responsible for proposing anti-Jewish measures to Marshal Pétain and for drafting the relevant legislation. The Commissariat-General was behind the second set of anti-Jewish legislative measures. It was supported by the Jewish Affairs Police Force, which was tasked with enforcing its decisions. It also included the Economic Aryanisation Department, from which part of its funding came. In July 1942, the Jewish Affairs Police Force became the Section for Enquiry and Control (SEC). It was vested with powers of investigation and arrest and was noted for its zealous collaboration with the German security services. The Papon affair highlighted the role of the Jewish Affairs Police Force in maintaining an up-to-date list of Jews in Bordeaux and sharing this list with the German authorities with a view to their deportation.</p>

    text: <p>The Association of French Rabbis hoped to limit the scope of the Vichy government’s planned anti-Jewish laws. But these hopes were quickly dashed with the enactment of the first set of anti-Jewish legislative measures on 3 October 1940. Under the law of 25 November 1941, Jews were required to join the General Union of French Jews (UGIF), which was under the authority of the occupying forces. Every member of the Jewish community had to pay a fixed sum of 120 francs or face detention. Lucienne Scheid-Hass was tasked with organising a regional delegation in Bordeaux. The chief rabbi, Joseph Cohen, was automatically appointed as the local head of the UGIF and was required to fulfil the German authorities’ requisition requests and follow the instructions of the occupying forces, while at the same arranging urgent assistance with limited resources. Many Jews accused UGIF members of treason. But there was nothing they could do to change a warped system whose ultimate objective was unknown to them and which forced them to contribute to their own extermination.</p>

His courage during his time as a chaplain in the First World War was honoured by a commendation in the Order of the Division and the award of the War Cross with palm leaves. As chief rabbi, he consolidated the Portuguese rites that were typical of Bordeaux’s Jewish community. He also built assistance and charity networks during his 55 years of service. He was automatically appointed as the head of the General Union of French Jews (UGIF) in Bordeaux, working under extreme conditions to bring comfort to the Jewish community, which faced cruelty and genocide.</p>

    text: "<p>In 1941, the Vichy government opened Mérignac internment camp, situated close to Bordeaux, at the request of the German occupying forces. Many people considered “undesirable” by the new regime were detained there, including nomads, foreigners, communists, trade unionists and dissidents, as well as traffickers, pimps and prostitutes. The camp also housed many Jews following the Bousquet-Oberg accords of 1942. Close to 2,000 Jews from Bordeaux and elsewhere in Gironde were held there pending deportation. A large number of detainees at the camp were taken as hostages and executed by the Germans. Responsibility for monitoring the camp was entrusted to the <em>Gendarmerie Nationale</em>, the French military police. Facilities at the camp were extremely basic and the detainees were held in appalling conditions. The barracks holding the Jewish prisoners were separated from those housing other detainees by an internal wall. The camp was surrounded by a wooden fence reinforced with barbed wire and watchtowers. Severe overcrowding and unsanitary conditions made life in the camp a misery.</p>"

  - chapter: The intensification of racist anti-Semitism in occupied France
    text: <p>For obvious reasons, the Vichy government’s anti-Semitic rhetoric was reflected in Bordeaux’s local press. Newspapers <em>La Petite Gironde</em> and <em>La France de Bordeaux et du Sud-Ouest</em> were particularly noted for their zeal and venom towards the Jews – an editorial line that was provoked by the <em>Propagandastaffel</em>, the German propaganda unit which had its offices at 50 Rue Judaïque in Bordeaux. The <em>Institut d’Étude des Questions Juives</em> (Institute for Research on Jewish Affairs), founded in 1941, also disseminated Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda in its monthly magazine, <em>Le Cahier Jaune</em> (The Yellow Book). Its content developed increasingly racist undertones over time. In 1943, the organisation was renamed the <em>Institut d'Études des Questions Juives et Ethnoraciales</em> (Institute for Research on Jewish and Ethnoracial Affairs) and published a new magazine. On 15 April 1944, the anti-Semitic authors behind these magazines published a brochure entitled <em>Je vous hais</em> (I Hate You). It contained over 500 anti-Semitic documents, including many that focused exclusively on race theory and eugenics.</p>

        text: <p><em>Le Cahier Jaune</em> (The Yellow Book) was a magazine published by the <em>Institut d’Etude des Questions Juives</em> (Institute for Research on Jewish Affairs) in Paris. The magazine, initially issued monthly and, later, twice a month, was intended to spread the Nazis’ racist policy in France. It was published between 1 November 1941 and 13 February 1943. The magazine’s editor was anti-Semitic collaborator André Chaumet, who was a member of the <em>Parti franciste</em> (Francist Party). Henri Labroue, who was appointed as the head of the <em>Institut d’Etude des Questions Juives</em> in 1941, had previously been a professor of literary studies at the University of Bordeaux, as well as serving as a member of parliament for Gironde between 1914 and 1919, and again between 1928 and 1932. He was one of the magazine’s regular contributors. In 1943, Le Cahier Jaune was replaced with a new magazine entitled Revivre (Relive), with the subtitle <em>“Le grand magazine illustré de la race”</em> (The big illustrated magazine about race).</p>

    text: "<p>Through the <em>Institut d’Etude des Questions Juives</em> (Institute for Research on Jewish Affairs), the German authorities funded a racist and anti-Semitic exhibition entitled <em>Le Juif et la France</em> (Jews and France). It was intended to stoke anti-Semitic sentiment among the French population, as a way to justify and normalise the persecution of the Jews. The exhibition first appeared at the Palais Berlitz in Paris between 5 September 1941 and 15 January 1942. It was shown at the Museum of Painting and Sculpture, in the grounds of Bordeaux city hall, between 17 March and 10 May 1942. The exhibition was opened with great fanfare by the mayor of Bordeaux, Adrien Marquet. It included photographs, documents, objects and models purporting to support racist, anti-Semitic stereotypes. A series of lectures on the “Jewish question” was also held to coincide with the exhibition. An article published in newspaper La Petite Gironde on 20 January 1942 included the following words: “Forty days will suffice for our fellow citizens to understand the Jewish threat. <em>There is an old saying that, in a criminal investigation, one should always suspect the woman</em>. We now know that whatever misery, bankruptcy, financial ruin, scandal or war befalls us, we should always suspect the Jews.” Some 61,213 people visited the exhibition in total, including many schoolchildren.</p>"

The institute was led by professor Henri Labroue, who was actively involved in developing the exhibition. The anti-Semitic themes focused on recurring questions relating to the Jewish conspiracy, race, Jewish responsibility for the war and the need to expel Jews from society. The violence was even turned on its head, with the Jews being accused of organising “pogroms” in Hungary when, in fact, they were victims of persecution across Eastern Europe. The approval of the “Final Solution” – the extermination of the Jewish people – at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 casts the exhibition and accompanying lecture series in Bordeaux in a particular light.</p>"

  - chapter: Economic aryanisation and the seizure of Jewish property
    text: <p>Aryanisation – the seizure of Jewish property by the German authorities and the Vichy government – was a policy designed to exclude Jews from every part of social and economic life by stripping them of all means of existence. The order of 18 October 1940 required the identification of all Jewish-owned businesses and the eviction of their owners, who were replaced with appointed administrators. Businesses were considered to be Jewish-owned if more than one-third of their capital, shares or equity belonged to Jews. The temporary administrators were overseen by the Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs. The Departmental Commission for Aryanisation was set up in 1941, as a joint body between the <em>Feldkommandantur</em> and the Prefecture. The Department for the Seizure of Jewish Property was initially based at 3 Rue Ravez before moving to 56 Rue Croix de Seguey in 1943. Some 2,800 cases were examined, leading to the seizure of 600 buildings, 35 shops, 426 businesses and 306 plots of land. A section entitled “Sale of Jewish Property” appeared in local newspaper <em>La Petite Gironde</em>. Other seized property included bank accounts, furniture, tableware, lingerie and works of art.</p>

    text: "<p>Following the humiliation and seizure of property, the Nazis set about eliminating the Jews. The German order of 7 February 1942 confined Jews to their homes between 8pm and 5am and prohibited them from moving addresses, in order to make it easier to arrest them. Operation Spring Breeze, a planned round-up of Jews for deportation, was approved in Berlin on 11 June 1942. The regional prefect, Maurice Sabatier, entrusted responsibility for organising the round-up in Bordeaux to Maurice Papon, who was then general secretary of the Prefecture of Gironde. The German instructions read: “All Jews of both sexes, and wearing the yellow star, between the ages of 16 and 45, are to be arrested by the French police between 6 and 8 July and interned at Mérignac camp. <em>Younger children are to be entrusted to the care of the UGIF [General Union of French Jews]”</em>. The round-up, involving 400 police officers, began on 15 July. Some 70 Jews were arrested, including 45 in Bordeaux alone, while 23 children were separated from their parents and handed over to the UGIF pending deportation. In line with the German instructions, further round-ups took place on 13 August, overnight between 19 and 20 October, on 7 November and overnight between 20 and 21 December 1942. The vast round-up on 10-11 January 1944 led to the arrest of a further 473 people across the department. Michel Slitinsky and chief rabbi Joseph Cohen managed to escape. Boris Cyrulnik, who was six years old at the time, was saved by a third party.  The final round-ups occurred overnight between 4 and 5 February and on 4 March 1944.</p>"

Michel Slitinsky’s father was deported in the fourth convoy on 26 October 1942, while Boris Cyrulnik’s father was deported in the sixth convoy on 25 November 1943. Sabatino Schinazi, known as the “doctor to the poor” for his philanthropic actions, was also deported on 25 November. Professor Joseph Benzacar, the 86-year-old former deputy mayor, was deported in the penultimate convoy on 13 May 1944. The deportees were subsequently taken from Drancy transit camp to Auschwitz, travelling in harrowing conditions. The Prefecture of Bordeaux was responsible for organising the convoys leaving the city, which were escorted by the <em>Gendarmerie Nationale</em>, the French military police.</p>

They smashed the windows and chandeliers into thousands of pieces and loaded the wooden panelling onto trucks to be taken away and burned. The iconic temple of French Jews since 1812 had its walls blackened by flames, pierced by bullets and splattered with blood, its windows shattered. The synagogue was left ruined, desecrated and deserted, bereft of its Torah scrolls, which had been carried away by the waters of the Garonne.

The “ghost train” was one of the last mass transits carrying deportees to Dachau concentration camp. The train left Toulouse on 3 July 1944 and arrived at Bordeaux station on 9 July, with 580 prisoners crammed into livestock wagons. On board were a mixture of Spanish and Italian resistance fighters, and Jews from Poland and central Europe. On 12 July 1944, the 550 men on board the train were imprisoned in the Great Synagogue of Bordeaux, in conditions of unimaginable horror. Some of them tried to escape. Ten prisoners were executed by firing squad as a reprisal. The convoy left Saint-Jean station on 9 August 1944, headed for Germany. It carried an additional 155 prisoners who had previously been incarcerated at Fort du Hâ. The train reached its destination on 28 August 1944 after a gruelling 57-day journey. The 65 women on board were deported to Ravensbrück camp. Although some of the prisoners managed to escape with the help of French railway workers, only half of the 540 deportees who arrived at Dachau survived.</p>

    text: <p>The Consistory’s conciliatory attitude towards the Vichy government was rooted in a desire to soften the regime’s measures against the Jewish community. The anti-Jewish legislative measures introduced on 3 October 1940 showed that this approach had not worked. At the request of the Consistory, Louis Halphen, a former professor at the University of Bordeaux, tried to persuade Pétain that anti-Semitic propaganda was based on stereotypes that bore no resemblance to the reality of Jews in France, in an effort to achieve a change of policy. Most members of Bordeaux’s Jewish community accepted that they would have to live with the situation, although they had no idea of what was to come. Yet a minority of Jews refused to trust the authorities. Many fled the city to unoccupied France or emigrated to the United States. Others stayed in Bordeaux and went into hiding or joined the Resistance movement. One such person was the son of chief rabbi Joseph Cohen, who served as an intelligence agent in the Armée secrète (Secret Army) in Lyon from 1943. The rule requiring Jews to wear the yellow star met with demonstrations of sympathy from the local population. People sheltered Jews facing persecution in their homes, while non-Jewish sixth-form and university students in the city wore yellow stars as a gesture of solidarity.  On 15 January 1944, just a few days after the round-up on 10-11 January, a group of people showed the courage to demonstrate in sympathy with the Jewish community outside the synagogue.</p>

    text: <p>On 1 June 1942, the regional prefect, Maurice Sabatier, appointed Maurice Papon as general secretary of the Prefecture of Gironde. He oversaw the Prefecture’s departments including the Department of Jewish Affairs, for which he held signing authority. Having been in contact with the Resistance since 1943, he became director of the cabinet of the Commissioner of the Republic upon the liberation of France. The Bordeaux Liberation Committee contested the appointment, but to no avail. Papon went on to serve multiple terms as a prefect, including Prefect of Police between 1958 and 1967. He was also twice elected as mayor – of Gretz-Armainvilliers between 1955 and 1958, and of Saint-Amand-Montrond between 1971 and 1983 – and served two terms as a member of parliament for the Gaullist Party, in 1968-1971 and in 1973-1978. He served as Minister for the Budget under the presidency of Valery Giscard d’Estaing between 1978 and 1981. The “Papon affair” refers to the events of 1981, when documents signed by Papon relating to the deportation of Jews from Bordeaux during the war were discovered. He was indicted for crimes against humanity on 19 January 1983. Papon’s trial, which opened in Bordeaux on 8 October 1997, sought to uncover his exact role in the identification, arrest and deportation of 1,690 Jews, who had been rounded up between 1942 and 1944. The trial revealed the difficulty in establishing chains of criminal responsibility – individual and collective – during the occupation. Following a six-month trial, Papon was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for having been complicit in arrest and false imprisonment. The court found him not guilty of the charge of complicity in assassination.</p>
