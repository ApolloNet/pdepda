  - chapter: Introduction
    text: "<p>The post-war period was a complicated time for survivors, who were trying to piece together what remained of their past and rebuild a new life in a foreign land. Montreal, a major place of refuge for survivors of the Shoah, welcomed more than 9,000 people, beginning in 1947. The Quebec and Canadian city thus became a new home for the survivors who went there to settle, find work, pursue an education, and start a family.</p><p>This re-rooting, fed by resilience, was also an opportunity for each person to undertake the task of remembering and seek justice. Survivors wanted to make sure that history and culture would not be forgotten. They also hoped their lived experiences would serve to educate future generations on how to create a better future.</p><p>The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Montreal Holocaust Museum, which share a special connection on Montreal Jewish life, decided to create a dialogue between their collections to shine the spotlight on these extraordinary life stories. By combining the destinies of objects and donors, six themes are thus explored: the Rebuilding of Daily Life, the Quest for Memory, the Perpetuation of Culture, the Transmission of History, the Commemoration of Victims and the Restitution of Family Property.</p>"
  - chapter: The Rebuilding of Daily Life
    text: <p>Once installed, survivors wasted no time forging strong ties with their new homeland. Having become Montrealers, they in turn contributed markedly to the cultural and economic development of their community and city. Many of today’s businesses, neighbourhoods and art and museum institutions attest to this.</p>

        text: <p><strong>Master of the Legend of Saint Barbara</strong><br>Active in Brussels, about 1470 – about 1500</p><p>About 1490<br>Oil on wood<br>61.6 x 43.8 cm</p><p>Influenced by renowned mid-fifteenth century Bruges painter Van der Weyden, the Master of the Legend of Saint Barbara distinguishes himself in his idealized females, with their high, smooth foreheads and doe-eyed expressions. The Virgin and Child are seated on an ornately Gothic throne symbolizing the Church. Painted in brilliant colours of jewel-like intensity, the minutely studied details are compelling reflections of the Netherlandish fascination with the surfaces of the phenomenal world.</p><p>This work was donated to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts by Max Stern (1904-1987), a Jewish art dealer and the first gallery owner dealing in modern art in Montreal. The painting had belonged to his father, Julius, who had an Old Masters art gallery in Dusseldorf. Faced with the rise of Nazism, Stern immigrated to Montreal. He bequeathed this precious painting to the Museum. The restitution of works looted from the Dusseldorf gallery continues thanks to executors, Montreal universities Concordia and McGill, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/arts/max-stern.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.concordia.ca/arts/max-stern.html</a></p>

Max Stern (1904-1987) is considered to be one of the most important modern art dealers in Canadian history. Born in Germany and the son of collector and art dealer Julius Stern, Max earned a doctorate in art history and trained at his father’s gallery in Dusseldorf. Faced with the rise of Nazism, Stern sold the gallery in 1937 and moved to Paris and then to London. During World War II, he was forced to flee and was interned in a refugee camp on the Isle of Man – being a Jew but German citizen – before immigrating to Canada in 1941.</p><p>Starting in 1947, Max Stern ran the Dominion Gallery in Montreal for close to half a century, first as an associate and then as owner. He promoted living Canadian artists (Emily Carr, Paul-Émile Borduas...) and European artists (Kees Van Dongen, Jean Arp, Henry Moore...). After the war, Stern was able to recover some works from Dusseldorf that had been confiscated by the Nazis. Over the years, Max and his wife, Iris, amassed funds and a collection that they offered to various institutions, including the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Thanks to the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, the restitution of artworks continues. <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/arts/max-stern.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.concordia.ca/arts/max-stern.html</a></p>

  - chapter: The Quest for Memory
    text: <p>The task of remembering took on greater importance as survivors settled into their new lives. Attempts were made to gather and piece together family memories and recollections of past lives as well as to uncover missing information from loved ones, archive services and even return trips to their respective countries of origin. These quests took on a variety of forms and were often emotional.</p>

Beginning in 1830, Waldmüller spent his summers in the Berchtesgaden region of the Bavarian Alps. The pyramidal composition of <em>Children on Their Way Home from School</em> shows the long road – literally and figuratively – travelled by two poor Bavarian children returning from the village.  Sensitive to the problems of a society isolated from modernity, the artist bears witness to – above and beyond the initial charm of the representation – the importance of education.</p><p>This painting belonged to the Jewish industrialist Viktor Zuckerkandl, an important patron of Gustav Klimt. Upon his death, the painting passed on to his sister, Amalie Redlich. With the Anschluss in 1938, she was deported and her goods seized. After hiding in Belgium during the war, Amalie’s grandson, Georges Jorisch, moved to Montreal in 1957. He succeeded in recuperating certain despoiled goods, including two Klimt paintings and this exquisite work, which reminded him of his childhood. After his death and following his wishes, the painting was offered to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in recognition of the city’s hospitality. His granddaughter, Edith Jorisch, made a moving documentary on the adventures of this restitution, titled <em>L’Héritier</em>, in 2016.</p>

Jacques remained at the OSE orphanage in Le Vésinet for some time after the war. In 1953, the children residing there made this booklet.

    text: <p>In the face of danger, oppression and death, culture became a powerful act of spiritual resistance. In the ghettos, and later in the camps, language, traditions and the arts would serve as means of survival and maintaining hope. For the survivors, this is an essential cultural legacy that must be protected, shared and celebrated.</p>

        text: <p><strong>Gustav Klimt</strong><br>Vienna 1862 – Vienna 1918</p><p>1903<br>Conté crayon<br>31.6 x 45.4 cm</p><p>Austrian Gustav Klimt was among the most influential artists in Europe. His controversial, much admired and richly ornamental Art Nouveau paintings, are instantly identifiable by his use of gold. Klimt’s portraits depicted primarily women in the intellectual and social avant-garde. Adele Bloch-Bauer, the only woman he painted twice, was a leading figure in the intellectual life of Austria both before and after World War I. She married the international sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch, who adopted the name Bloch-Bauer, and his brother, Gustav, married Adele’s sister!</p><p>Over a decade after Adele’s passing, this Jewish family was expropriated by the Nazis, in 1938. Ferdinand fled to Switzerland, leaving his estate to Gustav’s children, who had settled in Vancouver, Canada. His niece kept one hundred drawings by Klimt, five of which she passed on to her son. Four of these were portraits of Adele, which he offered the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.</p><p>Maria Altmann, Gustav’s other daughter, moved to California, where in 2006 she won a historic case against the Austrian government in the American courts. The family obtained restitution of the Klimt portraits of Adele. Now sold, they are today enjoyed by the public at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Neue Galerie New York.</p>

When Nazi Germany invaded Czechoslovakia in 1939, his parents sent him to stay with relatives in Hungary. When this country was invaded in 1944, Alexander survived until the end of the war under the false name of Shrank Janosh. After the war, he went back to his family home in Trebišov only to find it had been pillaged and destroyed. One of the only possessions he was able to recover was his violin, which he took with him.</p>

In gratitude, Dix made him this extraordinary portrait. An exponent of the German New Objectivity movement, Dix denounced the social malaise and decadent pessimism of the Weimar Republic. In this warm portrait, devoid of caricature, the painter’s memory retraces the essence of his model. Condemned by the Nazis as a degenerate artist, Dix was forced to quit teaching, but he stayed in Germany and embarked on an “interior emigration.” Meanwhile, stripped of their citizenship, Simons and his family – along with this painting – sought refuge in Montreal.</p><p>The warmth that emanates from this portrait of Hugo Simons attests to the respect Otto Dix had for this attorney. Through his generosity, foresight and courage, Simons helped Jew and Gentile alike in face of the threat posed by the Third Reich. In 1933, alerted by a cousin in Dusseldorf whose family’s passports and valuables had been seized by the Gestapo, Simons gathered his possessions, including his portrait, and fled Germany. He and his family headed to the nearest train station and boarded a train for The Hague. Simons bribed German farmers along the border to allow them safe passage across their fields. Later, in 1939, their destination would be Montreal…</p>

In 1940, Pal was in Paris for business when he became trapped during the Nazi occupation of France. Unable to leave the country, he fled to the unoccupied Alps and hid. However, in 1943, he was reported and then arrested and deported to the Drancy transit camp. He lied about his trade in order to survive, claiming to be a stoker. He thus worked on the camp’s furnace until he was liberated in 1944.</p>

Along with this compensation, the Museum purchased <em>Woman Playing a Lute</em>, another Honthorst dated the same year, and dedicated it to the memory of Ellen Clara and Bruno Richard Spiro, victims of the Shoah.</p>

Judging his proposal as too daring, the jury turned down Auguste Rodin’s project. The sculpture’s mock-up remained in Rodin’s studio. In 1899, he called on foundry owner Léon Perzinka to render it in bronze for his retrospective at the Pavillon de l’Alma that would be shown concurrently with the Exposition universelle of 1900. Acquired by the Austrian collector Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer in 1901, <em>The Defence</em> was seized by the Nazis with the intention of incorporating it in the collection of the future Führermuseum Hitler had planned for Linz.</p><p>In 1946, Bloch-Bauer’s heirs demanded restitution of his collections. In 1948, <em>The Defence</em> was returned to his niece, Louise Gattin, who had settled in Vancouver. She intended to sell it to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, but the latter initially declined, as Rodin had fallen out of fashion. It took every ounce of dealer Max Stern’s insight and skill to persuade the institution to come back on its decision … and ever since 1961, this sculpture has stood proudly on public display!</p>
