  - chapter: Local archives and the Jewish question (1940-1944)
    text: <p>Recent decades have seen considerable progress in historical research about the Occupation. In France, Germany and the United States, access to previously closed archive holdings has let researchers delve into new areas of study, such as the Jewish Question and the French State’s responsibility in implementing measures against French Jews. While Nazi Germany was the instigator of an outright program to exterminate Jews in Europe, the Vichy government also collaborated in this plan in the French territory. By exploiting a generalized open anti-Semitism that had lain dormant among the political, economic, and intellectual elite and the public since the Dreyfus affair, the State pulled the country’s entire administrative system into collaboration with the Nazi plan.</p><p>This exhibition draws on the archives produced by the administration itself to deal with the Jewish Question during the Occupation. It shows how the measures of German authorities and the French State were applied at a communal level. The local impact, revealed through the fates of men and women who were a part of the daily lives of their fellow citizens, friends and colleagues, demonstrates the full human consequences of this repression.</p>
  - chapter: Administration of the Communes During the Occupation
    text: <p>The armistice signed on June 22, 1940 ratified the division of France into two zones separated by a demarcation line. In the north, or the “occupied zone,” the French State had to accommodate the German administration, which was essentially a military presence and was based in Paris. The government in Vichy freely administered the only departments in the free zone, or the southern part of the country and the colonies. Prefects became an essential part of the administration, from the top of the State authority down to the municipalities.</p><p>On July 10, legislators voted to give full powers to Marshal Pétain. Through a law enacted on November 16, 1940, the Vichy government abolished the election of municipal councillors and re-established their appointment by the Minister of the Interior in towns of over 10,000 people and by the Prefect for all others. Between 1940 and 1941, nearly 500 municipalities were dissolved. Communists, Jews, and Freemasons were excluded from the new legislative assemblies.</p>

        text: <p>As per the law enacted on November 16, 1940, René Lebret, who was elected mayor of Elbeuf in 1928, submitted a list of 40 names from which the Prefect chose 19 councillors. Each councillor had to submit a disclosure form with details about his situation regarding the Statute of Foreigners (July 17, 1940), the Statute on the Jews (October 3 and November 16, 1940), and measures taken against secret societies, such as Freemasonry (August 13, 1940).</p>

However, he voted to give full powers to Pétain in 1940. A staunch anti-communist, he became politically aligned with the French Socialist Party and then the Republican Socialist Union. After the Liberation, he was sentenced to forfeiture of his civic rights by the Rouen Court for overseeing the Vichy regime's propaganda efforts in Normandy.</p>

  - chapter: Vichy's Anti-Jewish Laws
    text: <p>After being invested with full authority, Pétain and the Vichy government gradually enacted a full-fledged policy of racial discrimination against foreign and French-born Jews. In July 1940, several laws were passed to exclude them from society. On October 3, 1940, the “First Statute on the Jews” barred them from many vocations, including positions in the civil service. The “Second Statute” was enacted on June 2, 1941. People of Jewish faith had to submit a written declaration to the prefecture. In July 1942, the Vichy government took the ultimate step by taking part in the first deportations.</p>

    text: "<p>Jewish business owners suffered great hardship from the measures of the occupiers and the Vichy regime, particularly from the law of economic “Aryanization” enacted on July 22, 1941. This system was in fact a way to steal Jewish property through the transfer of companies to provisional administrators to be sold to “Aryan” buyers or liquidated. In Elbeuf, this practice affected many companies created after the annexation of Alsace, such as wool fabric factories like Fraenckel-Herzog and Blin & Blin or the Weill-Kingsbourg-Bernheim clothing factory.</p>"

This agreement led to a fictitious “Aryanization” of the company, which took the name Anciens établissements Blin et Blin (Former Blin & Blin Establishments), as of June 21, 1940.</p>"

In 1943, it was designated as a <em>Sperr-Betrieb</em> (on initiative of the Third Reich Armaments Minister Albert Speer) and was therefore exempt from having labour taken away for the Service du travail obligatoire (Compulsory Labour Service, STO). Much of its production of military cloth went to the occupation authorities.</p>"

    text: <p>Repression of the Jews intensified through the Vichy government’s active collaboration with the Nazi regime. The Final Solution, whose goal was the total extermination of the Jews in Europe, was decided and planned at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942.</p><p>According to the 1940 census, the Jewish community in Elbeuf targeted by the anti-Jewish measures consisted of 92 people. Between 1942 and 1944, 34 of them were arrested and deported. Others, such as the members of the Blin family, fled and were forced into hiding until the Liberation.</p>
