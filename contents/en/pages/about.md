## Jewish Fates During the Second World War

Rouen, Marseille, Montreal are three port cities built on trade. These cities have become repositories of the splendour, pageantry and conquests of the past. However, their museums also house memories of dark times and humble people caught up in the turmoil of history. Although more hidden, the fates of these individuals are no less filled with victories, defeats, glories and tragedies.

This virtual exhibition is set against the backdrop of the Second World War and resurfaces archives, photographs, objects, and art works, many of which have never been seen before and that form individual pieces of a much larger puzzle. From Normandy in the occupied zone to Provence in the free zone, the exhibition follows the fate of French and European Jewish citizens hunted down by Nazi occupiers and their accomplices or by the Vichy regime. The journeys of some ended in deportation and death while others ended in salvation in Canada, the land of welcome.

By combining collections from these three cities—La Fabrique des Savoirs in Elbeuf near Rouen, the Musée d'Histoire de Marseille, and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Montreal Holocaust Museum across the Atlantic in Montreal—, we can shed tremendous light on the concrete reality of anti-Jewish laws and their barbaric bureaucratic machinery. The exhibition also contains testimonials of resilience and hope in the long journey toward exile, reconstruction and reparations. Its objects tell us about Alexander, Amalie, Avrum, Max, David, Donna, Edwig, Emilie, Georges, Hugo, Illana, Jacques, Jeannine, Louis, Pal, Sarah, Tola, Victor, Wilhem and many others. Let’s listen to their voices.

# Credits & acknowledgements

This exhibition came about during the major COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020. In response to the call for projects launched by the FRAME network (French American Museum Exchange, a group of 32 French and North American museums), museums in Rouen, Montreal and Marseille turned to online tools to continue their activities. On the initiative of La Fabrique des Savoirs in Elbeuf, the theme of Jewish fates during the Second World War emerged as a relevant theme for a cross-Atlantic collaboration. After intense efforts on either side of the ocean, and thanks to generous support from the FRAME network, this unique exhibition was created in just a few weeks.

We want to extend special thanks to the following people for their commitment and contribution:

We also thank everyone, and some of whom are no longer with us, who allowed us to preserve the memory of this tragic moment in history: Germaine Guillotin-Thiry, Albert Blin (a former director of the Blin & Blin company), as well as Denise Chauvel and Michel Zimmern.
